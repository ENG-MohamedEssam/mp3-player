# MP3 Player using STM32
#### This is an embedded systems project that uses an STM32 microcontroller to create an MP3 player. The STM32 is a powerful microcontroller with a wide range of peripherals and features, making it a popular choice for embedded systems projects.

#### One of the key aspects of the project is the use of custom-written drivers, specifically for the Systick timer. The Systick timer driver is responsible for controlling the timing of the song playback, ensuring that the song is played at the correct tempo and in the correct order.

#### To play the sound, I used R2R DAC (Resistor ladder digital-to-analog converter) which is a simple and inexpensive way to convert digital signal to analog signal. Additionally, I used an op-amp to amplify the sound output from the DAC. This allowed me to produce high-quality audio output from the microcontroller.

#### The project also demonstrates my ability to work with different types of data, specifically audio data in this case, and my ability to manipulate and process that data in order to make it usable by the microcontroller. Furthermore, the ability to develop a timer driver shows my understanding of time-sensitive systems and my ability to work with low-level system features.

### This is a demonstration of the project , note that the sound is still low so you need to make it at it's highest to hear the song
